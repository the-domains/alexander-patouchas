description: "I'm half Finnish half Greek hence only 50% bankrupt. Excited about a bunch of things as long as it's intellectually pleasing. Whatever that means. I was born in Finland. Spent all the childhood summers in Greece. Lived for a semester in the city of London - no not in the UK but in Ontario, Canada."
